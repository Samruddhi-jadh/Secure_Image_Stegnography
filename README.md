## ✨ Features  
✅ **Hide Encrypted Messages** – Embed encrypted text into images using **LSB steganography**.  
✅ **Extract Hidden Messages** – Decode and decrypt the secret message from the stego-image.  
✅ **AES Encryption (Optional)** – Encrypt messages before embedding for added security.  
✅ **Streamlit GUI** – A simple web-based UI for encoding and decoding.  
✅ **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** – Supports **CLI-based embedding and extraction**.  
✅ **Supports Multiple Image Formats** – Works with **PNG, JPG, and BMP** files.  
✅ **Lightweight & Open Source** – Easy to install, modify, and use.
